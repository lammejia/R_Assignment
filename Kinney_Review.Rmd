## Review

#Part One: Running All Code

When running all the code at once, an error occurs at line 158:
"Error in order(as.integer(teosinte_i$Position), decreasing=T,):
  argument is missing, with no default"
This error is resolved by moving the ',' out of parentheses after "decreasing=T"
This error also occurs in line 162.

There are also errors for lines 180, 182, 184, 186, 190, 192 because of referencing a personal directory.

Code otherwise runs smoothly. 
The "view" commands in the data inspection take the longest to run, and using "head" and "tail" commands might be sufficient instead.

#Part Two: Other Comments

In your maize files, the Sample IDs of the columns are now V1, V2, V3, etc. Was this intentional?

In lines 158 and 162, you use "maize_i" in code for teosinte. I am not sure if you meant to do this, or if it supposed to be "teosinte_i" instead.

#Part Three: Overall

Overall, the code is clean with good explanation of steps throughout.
